# Author-Identification-of-Articles
A multi-class text classification project to identify the authors of Turkish newspaper articles.

This project aimed to classify Turkish-language articles by author using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization. The Zemberek library was utilized for tokenization and stemming. A 5-Fold Cross-Validation strategy was applied to ensure balanced evaluation, and model performance was assessed using precision, recall, and F1-score.
